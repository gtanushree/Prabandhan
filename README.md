# 📘 Prabandhan – Interdepartmental Coordination Platform for Smart Governance

**Prabandhan** is a simulated data-driven platform designed to enhance interdepartmental coordination at the city level — beginning with Agra. It supports better planning, scheduling, conflict resolution, and resource optimization for government projects through structured data and future visual tools.

## 🔧 Current Features

- 📋 **Synthetic Dataset** of 10,000+ projects generated using realistic parameters (timeline, location, collaboration).
- 🧰 **Resource Inventory** assigned to each project based on its type.
- 🧠 **Collaborating Departments** logic based on actual government workflows.
- 📍 **Real Agra Localities** to support future geospatial integration.

## 🛠️ In Development

- 🌐 **Web Interface** planned using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
  - For data visualization, dashboards, and interaction
- 📈 Integration of Gantt charts, project filters, and search by department/locality
- 🧠 Conflict checking & scheduling module (future extension)
